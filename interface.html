        Tastes of people vary. Locals will rarely step into those restaurants open for foreigners as General Tso’s Chicken will never show up on a Chinese family’s table. When searching for a restaurant, we desire the opinions from those who have similar tastes and understand how to appreciate those dishes.

      Ye!Pro is an App that helps you to find out what best fit your taste. Based on Yelp’s data, we created an improved rating system that demonstrates you the reviews and scores from those who have similar tastes with you and those who are most authentic in eating as well.
